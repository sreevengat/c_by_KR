 * Ans: If it is macro functions, then
 * space grows, and save time (run faster)
 * (this will run like inline statements)
 *
 * if it is functions , then space can be
 * saved and loss of time due to function call
 * overhead (pushing some registers on
 * to the stack , need to jump to that
 * function).
